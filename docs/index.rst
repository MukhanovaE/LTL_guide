How to work with this document
In our world of a free market economy, everything has to be paid for. We convert our free energy into successful
projects and outstanding results. The total energy (as you probably know) is preserved, so the more initial energy
one have – the better. This provides you with more possible states, gives you the ability to interact and excite
others, and makes the cryogenic lab slightly warmer (climate change disclaimer). Going through this guide, you
will adsorb energy quants for each successful step (do not worry if your energy is already high in some fields – it
opens even more states for you in the future!).
It is up to you how would you warm up – first filling each ground state, then the first exited state, and so on
thus becoming open for a variety of future states; or choose the most relevant area for your project and try to
maximize your excitation here (but try to avoid population inversion – negative temperatures are also dangerous).
Whether you choose science to be your future or not, having energy above the gap is an essential thing to be
outstanding. For those who reach the highest excitation state, success is unavoidable.
